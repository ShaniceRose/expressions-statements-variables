//1.) Log an expression that evaluates to the sum of two integers
let theSum = 10 + 8;
console.log('answer 1', theSum);

// 2.) log an expression that evaluates to the difference of two integers
// your code here 
let theDiffence = 10 - 8;
console.log('answer 2', theDifference);

// 3.) Log an expression that concatenates the two strings "I'm writing" and "my first JavaScript code"
let sentence = "This is a sentence"
let anotherSentence = "this is the second half"
let fullSentence = sentence + anotherSentence
console.log('answer 3', fullSentence );

// 4.) Log an expression that evaluates to true or false using two numbers that are greater or less than eachother
let compare = 8 > 4;
console.log('answer 4', compare);

// 5.) Log an expression that uses modulo, with a result of 4
let remainder = 32%7;
console.log('answer 5',remainder);

// 6.) Assign a variable and console log the declaration

console.log('answer 6',);

// 7.) Console log a variable assigned to the sum of two numbers
let theSumOfTwoNumbers = 8 + 8
console.log('answer 8');

// 8.) Uncomment this if else statement and add a logical expression as the condition
if (9 > 14) {
   console.log('It was!')
} else {
   console.log('It was not..')

// 9.) Add parenthesis to the following statement, the result should be 1
let answer = 3 * (3 + 1 )
